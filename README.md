<h1>My Project anylize Score of Student University for year 2024 </h1> 
<h2>List Student Who did not take the exam or take the exam </h2>
<img src="">
<p>We can see quantity student didn't take exam field natural (vat_li , hoa_hoc, sinh_hoc) than  field social (lich_su, dia_ly_gdcd)
. I can predict students love industry marketing , social media , news . I think it have a higher chance of getting a job than natural field.
On the contrary, the fields of science and technology require a certain level of education and many years of continuous learning. The salary after graduation is not stable and some fields in this field have a slower graduation progress than other fields. For example, the medical field.</p>
